The role that big data analytics may have in interrogating the patient electronic health record toward improved clinical decision support is discussed. We examine developments in pharmacogenetics that have increased our appreciation of the reasons why patients respond differently to chemotherapy. We also assess the expansion of online health communications and the way in which this data may be capitalized on in order to detect public health threats and control or contain epidemics. Finally, we describe how a new generation of wearable and implantable body sensors may improve wellbeing, streamline management of chronic diseases, and improve the quality of surgical implants.},

abstract = {It is a very exciting time for health care and information technology (IT). Due to improvements in genetic research and the advancement of precision medicine, health care is witnessing an innovative approach to disease prevention and treatment that incorporates an individual patient's genetic makeup, lifestyle and environment. Simultaneously, IT advancement has produced large databases of health information, provided tools to track health data and engaged individuals more in their own health care. Combining these advancements in health care and information technology would foster transformative change in the field of health IT. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act required all public and private health care providers to adopt electronic medical records (EMR) by January 1, 2014, in order to maintain their existing Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement levels. This EMR mandate spurred significant growth in the availability and utilization of EMRs. However, the vast majority of these systems do not have the capacity to share their health data. Blockchain technology has the potential to address the interoperability challenges currently present in health IT systems and to be the technical standard that enables individuals, health care providers, health care entities and medical researchers to securely share electronic health data. In this paper we describe a blockchain based access-control manager to health records that would advance the industry interoperability challenges expressed in the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's (ONC) Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap. Interoperability is also a critical component any infrastructure supporting Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) and the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). A national health IT infrastructure based on blockchain has far-reaching potential to promote the development of precision medicine, advance medical research and invite patients to be more accountable for their health.},

abstract = {We have entered a transformative period in cancer prevention (including early detection). Remarkable progress in precision medicine and immune-oncology, driven by extraordinary recent advances in genome-wide sequencing, big-data analytics, blood-based technologies, and deep understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), has provided unprecedented possibilities to study the biology of premalignancy. The pace of research and discovery in precision medicine and immunoprevention has been astonishing and includes the following clinical firsts reported in 2015: driver mutations detected in circulating cell-free DNA in patients with premalignant lesions (lung); clonal hematopoiesis shown to be a premalignant state; molecular selection in chemoprevention randomized controlled trial (RCT; oral); striking efficacy in RCT of combination chemoprevention targeting signaling pathway alterations mechanistically linked to germline mutation (duodenum); molecular markers for early detection validated for lung cancer and showing promise for pancreatic, liver, and ovarian cancer. Identification of HPV as the essential cause of a major global cancer burden, including HPV16 as the single driver of an epidemic of oropharyngeal cancer in men, provides unique opportunities for the dissemination and implementation of public health interventions. Important to immunoprevention beyond viral vaccines, genetic drivers of premalignant progression were associated with increasing immunosuppressive TME; and Kras vaccine efficacy in pancreas genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model required an inhibitory adjuvant (Treg depletion). In addition to developing new (e.g., epigenetic) TME regulators, recent mechanistic studies of repurposed drugs (aspirin, metformin, and tamoxifen) have identified potent immune activity. Just as precision medicine and immune-oncology are revolutionizing cancer therapy, these approaches are transforming cancer prevention. Here, we set out a brief agenda for the immediate future of cancer prevention research (including a "Pre-Cancer Genome Atlas" or "PCGA"), which will involve the inter-related fields of precision medicine and immunoprevention - pivotal elements of a broader domain of personalized public health.

In the current paper, it is argued that in order to fulfill the promise of P4 medicine, a "fifth P" must be integrated - the population perspective - into each of the other four components. A population perspective integrates predictive medicine into the ecologic model of health; applies principles of population screening to preventive medicine; uses evidence-based practice to personalize medicine; and grounds participatory medicine on the three core functions of public health: assessment, policy development, and assurance. Population sciences - including epidemiology; behavioral, social, and communication sciences; and health economics, implementation science, and outcomes research - are needed to show the value of P4 medicine.

There also appears to be conflicts between complex systems approaches and traditional statistical methodologies, both in terms of their underlying strategies and the languages they use. We argue that the conflicts are resolvable, and the sooner the better for the field. In this article, we show how statistical and systems science approaches can be reconciled, and how together they can advance solutions to complex problems.

abstract = {Probabilistic linkage technology makes it feasible and efficient to link large public health databases in a statistically justifiable manner. The problem addressed by the methodology is that of matching two files of individual data under conditions of uncertainty. Each field is subject to error which is measured by the probability that the field agrees given a record pair matches (called the m probability) and probabilities of chance agreement of its value states (called the u probability). Fellegi and Sunter pioneered record linkage theory. Advances in methodology include use of an EM algorithm for parameter estimation, optimization of matches by means of a linear sum assignment program, and more recently, a probability model that addresses both m and u probabilities for all value states of a field. This provides a means for obtaining greater precision from non-uniformly distributed fields, without the theoretical complications arising from frequency-based matching alone. The model includes an interative parameter estimation procedure that is more robust than pre-match estimation techniques. The methodology was originally developed and tested by the author at the U.S. Census Bureau for census undercount estimation. The more recent advances and a new generalized software system were tested and validated by linking highway crashes to Emergency Medical Service (EMS) reports and to hospital admission records for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).},

abstract = {Public health is local " Public health is local, and similarly local information is required to increase awareness among residents and policy makers alike of the unique challenges facing communities " , conclude Laura Dwyer-Lindgren and colleagues in an Article published in this issue of The Lancet Public Health. In their study investigating variation in life expectancy and mortality by cause among neighbourhoods in King County, WA, USA, between 1990 and 2014, the Global Burden of Disease Study group applies latest small area estimation methods to mortality data in King County—a county that includes the city of Seattle, 2 million individuals, and where life expectancy is among the highest in the USA. What is hidden behind this high life expectancy at county level is an astonishing gap of more than 18 years for men and more than 14 years for women between communities. Subdividing the county into 397 census tracks and examining cause-specific mortality and years of life lost from 152 causes of deaths has allowed Dwyer-Lindgren and colleagues to unravel not only these huge life expectancy differences between neighbourhoods, but also to identify areas where the burden of specific cause of death is substantially higher. Such patterns of health disparity can reveal or suggest important underlying determinants. The granularity of outcomes and possible causes reported redefines the meaning of public health and offers new opportunities for action. For Sandro Galea, who has written an accompanying Comment, if Dwyer-Lindgren and colleagues' data are a reminder of the health divides within the USA, more important still are the stark, geographically adjacent differences that illustrate the heterogeneity in population health. Because population health is usually measured at a national or regional level, governments and public health agencies aspire to measure health successes at these levels, notes Galea. " Unfortunately, the easiest way to improve overall county health is through efforts that reach those who are easiest to reach, improving overall health by targeting the so-called already health haves. This approach stands to improve overall county health while widening intra-county health divides. " Dwyer-Lindgren and colleagues' detailed mapping of variability in life expectancy and mortality by cause opens avenues for further research and could lead to an equally detailed micro-level mapping of the determinants of health and health needs of communities. The findings could also guide local interventions to tackle inequalities and improve the health of local populations. Is it time to think about public health more locally? Mayors of cities around the world increasingly seem to believe in the power of acting locally. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been considered the " first public health mayor " when he took a series of controversial positions to improve the health of New Yorkers. Writing in The Lancet last year, his successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, recognised the part cities can play in public health: " the way we design our cities can help build healthy lives " . To support Mayors and local authorities designing their cities and their future, WHO's Healthy Cities programme has been promoting policy and urban planning with health at its core. The four guiding principles they recommend are the need to address inequality in health and urban poverty, the needs of vulnerable groups, participatory governance, and the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. While the centrality of public health for sustainable urbanisation will be key to tackle health inequalities and improve social justice, Helen Cole and colleagues note in a Comment that the development of healthy and equitable cities has proven more difficult than anticipated. They warn of potential risks for increasing rather than reducing social inequities—in particular, when investments lead to gentrification of neighbourhoods and exclusion of the most marginalised. In a Letter reflecting on the health and safety of the most vulnerable in UK cities, in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in London earlier this year, Faheem Ahmed and colleagues point out that " smart city plans have so far been led by the private sector, which has been reluctant to prioritise the importance of public health " . Public health science is now reaching a degree of precision that could provide us with street-level health outcomes and determinants of health. New disciplines, such as urban health, offer new opportunities for research and potential interventions. With cities and local communities becoming the new unit of public health, it is it time to think and act much more locally. ■ The Lancet Public Health},

Being born too early is associated with major risks to the child with potential for serious consequences in terms of life-long disability and health care costs. Discovering how to prevent preterm birth needs to be one of our greatest priorities. Recent advances have provided hope that a percentage of cases known to be related to risk factors may be amenable to prevention, but the majority of cases remain of unknown cause and there is little chance of prevention. Applying the principle of precision public health may offer opportunities previously unavailable. Presented in this article are ideas that may improve our abilities in the fields of studying the effects of migration and of populations in transition, public health programs, tobacco control, routine measurement of length of the cervix in mid-pregnancy by ultrasound imaging, prevention of non-medically indicated late preterm birth, identification of pregnant women for whom treatment of vaginal infection may be of benefit, and screening by genetics and other ‘omics'. Opening new research in these fields, and viewing these clinical problems through a prism of precision public health, may produce benefits that will affect the lives of large numbers of people.},

Jonathan Sterne and colleagues describe the appropriate use and reporting of the multiple imputation approach to dealing with them Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological and clinical research but their potential to undermine the validity of research results has often been overlooked in the medical literature.1 This is partly because statistical methods that can tackle problems arising from missing data have, until recently, not been readily accessible to medical researchers. However, multiple imputation—a relatively flexible, general purpose approach to dealing with missing data—is now available in standard statistical software,2 3 4 5 making it possible to handle missing data semiroutinely. Results based on this computationally intensive method are increasingly reported, but it needs to be applied carefully to avoid misleading conclusions.In this article, we review the reasons why missing data may lead to bias and loss of information in epidemiological and clinical research. We discuss the circumstances in which multiple imputation may help by reducing bias or increasing precision, as well as describing potential pitfalls in its application. Finally, we describe the recent use and reporting of analyses using multiple imputation in general medical journals, and suggest guidelines for the conduct and reporting of such analyses. Consequences of missing dataResearchers usually address missing data by including in the analysis only complete cases —those individuals who have no missing data in any of the variables required for that analysis. However, results of such analyses can be biased. Furthermore, the cumulative effect of missing data in several variables often leads to exclusion of a substantial proportion of the original sample, which in turn causes a substantial loss of precision and power.The risk of bias due to missing data depends on the reasons why data are missing. Reasons for missing data are commonly classified as: missing {\ldots} },

abstract = {The current article presents new opportunities for medicine and public health through social and behavioral information in electronic health records. The convergence of medicine and public health is reflected in renewed interest among healthcare providers in broadening the focus of medical practice beyond the individual patient to the communities and other contexts in which patients live. This trend has been fueled in part by financial incentives. The inclusion of social and behavioral information in electronic health records (EHRs) represents an opportunity to improve both clinical care and public health. With adequate attention to privacy and security, EHRs have the potential to collect and store standard measures of social and behavioral determinants, making this information available not only to clinicians but also to patients, health systems, public health organizations, and researchers. The incorporation of social and behavioral information in EHRs and its potential uses in both clinical practice and public health research and action presents renewed opportunities for rich and productive collaborations between medicine and public health in ways that have not been possible in the past. This type of collaboration will both enhance clinical care and improve population heath. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Khoury2016a,
abstract = {Announcement of the precision medicine initiative has led to a variety of responses, ranging from enthusiastic expectations1 to explicit skepticism,2 about potential health benefits, limitations, and return on investment. This Viewpoint discusses whether precision medicine is unlikely or likely to improve population health, aiming to forge a consensus that bridges disparate perspectives on the issue. The potential of precision medicine to improve the health of individuals or small groups of individuals is not addressed here because it involves a different question with different metrics.},

@article{Beheshti2017a,
abstract = {Social networks as well as neighborhood environments have been shown to effect obesity-related behaviors including energy intake and physical activity. Accordingly, harnessing social networks to improve targeting of obesity interventions may be promising to the extent this leads to social multiplier effects and wider diffusion of intervention impact on populations. However, the literature evaluating network-based interventions has been inconsistent. Computational methods like agent-based models (ABM) provide researchers with tools to experiment in a simulated environment. We develop an ABM to compare conventional targeting methods (random selection, based on individual obesity risk, and vulnerable areas) with network-based targeting methods. We adapt a previously published and validated model of network diffusion of obesity-related behavior. We then build social networks among agents using a more realistic approach. We calibrate our model first against national-level data. Our results show that network-based targeting may lead to greater population impact. We also present a new targeting method that outperforms other methods in terms of intervention effectiveness at the population level.},

@article{Dolley2018,
abstract = {Abstract: Precision public health is an emerging practice to more granularly predict and understand public health risks and customize treatments for more specific and homogeneous sub-populations, often using new data, technologies, and methods. Big data is one element that has consistently helped to achieve these goals, through its ability to deliver to practitioners a volume and variety of structured or unstructured data not previously possible. Big data has enabled more widespread and specific research and trials of stratifying and segmenting populations at risk for a variety of health problems. Examples of success using big data are surveyed in surveillance and signal detection, predicting future risk, targeted interventions, and understanding disease. Using novel big data or big data approaches has risks that remain to be resolved. The continued growth in volume and variety of available data, decreased costs of data capture, and emerging computational methods mean big data success will likely be a required pillar of precision public health into the future. This review article aims to identify the precision public health use cases where big data has added value, identify classes of value that big data may bring, and outline the risks inherent in using big data in precision public health efforts.},
