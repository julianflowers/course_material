## What is precision public health?

  - A recently coined term first appearing in print in 2014 (Dolley
    2018)
  - Sparse literature
  - Various definitions but all encompass a set of consistent ideas:
      - Use of *big data* and new tehcnology to improve health
      - Data used to give more precise descriptions of populations and
        individuals
      - Application of new techniques and methods
      - Speed, accuracy and scale
      - “the application and combination of new and existing
        technologies, which more precisely describe and analyse
        individuals and their environment over the life course, to
        tailor preventive interventions for at-risk groups and improve
        the overall health of the population.” (Weeramanthri et al.
        2018)
      - “improving the ability to prevent disease, promote health, and
        reduce health disparities in populations by applying emerging
        methods and technologies for measuring disease, pathogens,
        exposures, behaviors, and susceptibility in populations; and
        developing policies and targeted implementation programs to
        improve health” (Khoury and Galea 2016)
      - “requires robust primary surveillance data, rapid application of
        sophisticated analytics to track the geographical distribution
        of disease, and the capacity to act on such information”
        (Dowell, Blazes, and Desmond-Hellmann 2016)
      - “Precision public health is characterized by discovering,
        validating, and optimizing care strategies for
        well-characterized population strata” (Arnett and Claas 2016)

## Current and possible uses

Current literature has identified 4 main use cases for precision public
health:

1.  Disease surveillance and signal detection
2.  Risk prediction
3.  Targeting treatment interventions
4.  Improved disease understanding

These are largely in environmental health and communicable disease
control. The only studies identified by Dolley in non-communicable
disease or broader public health relate to diabetes.

Examples developing of:

  - Synthesizing data, academic literature and expert opinion for
    priority setting
    (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00125/full>)
  - Combining big and “smaller” data
    (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2016.00248/full>)

## Precision ph vs precision medicine

There has been some debate about the relationship or otherwise between
precision medicince and precision public health. There are number of
strands:

1.  The 4 Ps of precision medicine (Predictive, Preventive,
    Personalised, Particpatory) should be extended to 5 with the
    addition of P for “population”…
2.  Some argue that the two are unconnected
3.  Some argue that the precision medicine is the antithesis of public
    health and that precision medicine may increase inequality, and
    divert resources and focus away from population health and
    prevention
4.  Many agree that the distinction is unhelpful and that they are two
    sides of the same
    coin.

    ## [2] "Both classical public health and health promotion provide  the foundations of a further leap forward for prevention; the personalisation  of risk assessment and interventions for the individual, so called personalised prevention. This is a new paradigm  for disease prevention that we wish to promote. Like health promotion it is  effected through human agency, but unlike the undifferentiated messages typical  of health promotion, personalised  prevention takes into account  individual susceptibility to disease risk (which has a biological  basis), individual  values and concepts of utility (which are social and culturally determined)  and the need for individual autonomous decision making  about the take-up of preventive interventions. The interventions that it offers  require an individualised risk assessment and the provision of advice or preventive  management as an interaction between the individual and some form of health  professional, classically recognised as a clinical activity. "
    ## [3] "Risk assessments are likely to include some combination of  clinical and family history, a range of biomarkers and imaging for risk or  early disease, and increasingly the use of biosensors. Interventions may range  from intensive weight reduction based on individual assessment of eating  habits, to the recommendation of devices and mobile apps or prescription of pharmacological  agents for chemoprevention. Finally, unlike Geoffrey Rose’s distinction between the use of population  and high risk strategies in prevention, personalised  prevention does not only target high risk individuals.  It may equally be directed at those at lower  risk who may or may not require further intervention. Properly advised, these  people will experience less inconvenience and even harm from unnecessary  interventions. There will also be the potential for reduced cost or more  efficient use of preventive services."                                                                                                
    ## [4] "Classical public health, health promotion and the new field  of personalised prevention will all be important activities in the future but  there is a question about how they will best be practised. The first two would  seem logically to remain with public health professionals and the local  authorities to which they have recently been relocated. However, the personal  interaction, clinical testing and sometimes medical interventions required for  personalised prevention would not sit comfortably within this structure, which  does not deal with individual patients, nor would it be within the skill set of  most current public health practitioners."

## Implications for health intelligence

In some ways these ideas are nothing new - our users and stakeholders
continually want more granularity and timeliness, more comprehensive
data and insight, and actionable data linked to intervention. We have
anlytical techniques like population segmentation, risk profiling and
geodemographics.

Modernisation of surveillance, epidemiology, information systems and
targeted interventions with population health prespective.

Precision and precision PH implies:

  - More granular data - build up from smallest analytical unit by
    default (e.g. SOA for populations, GP for clinical populations).
  - More timely data - latest available data by default
  - More granular time data - smallest feasible time unit (e.g. day,
    week or month)
  - Incorporating big and small data
  - Balanced against issues of information and data governance
    (re-identification risk)
  - Large scale ecological linkage (e.g. large datasets of small area
    data - phenomics)
  - Cohort development - requires linkage e.g. people with specific
    conditions
  - Better measures of disease frequency - incidence for prevention,
    prevalence for burden and planning =\> data linkage
  - Improved risk factor estimation and surveillance
  - Combining multiple datasets - “n-tangulation”
  - Application of new techniques - timeseries/ forcasting, predictive
    models and machine learning (unsupervised and supervised)
  - Complexity/ network
analysis
